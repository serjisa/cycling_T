# Cell types annotation of cycling T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment
This is a repository for scientific project in the Institute of Bioinformatics, 2023

## Introduction

Single-cell transcriptomics is a powerful tool for analyzing the tissues of living organisms. One of its applications is the analysis of the population of T-lymphocytes of people suffering from various diseases, in particular cancer.
Based on the analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of T-cells infiltrating tumors, it is possible to make assumptions about the course of the disease and the appropriate therapy for the patient, as well as to study the dynamics of the development of the disease in the course of fundamental research. From this point of view, it is especially important to know which groups of lymphocytes are cycling. Howeve, the signal of cycling stage markers in such cells is stronger than the signal of cell type markers. When defining clusters, dividing cells usually form a separate cluster, which makes it impossible to tell which cell type the dividing cell belongs to.

The main goal of this work is to develop a method for determining the types of dividing cells and its application for the analysis of T cells from the tumor microenvironment.
